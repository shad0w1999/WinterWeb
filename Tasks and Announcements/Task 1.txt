Hey everyone :)

So we're going to get started with the first task. Make a simple HTML page that says Hello World, with a few specifications:

1. The font should be monotype corsiva.
2. The font size should be 40.
3.The background colour of the entire page should be light blue.

As an extra challenge, the hello world should be horizontally and vertically aligned on your page.

When you're done, follow the same procedure. Clone the repo (if you haven't already done it), copy the files into your folder locally, add them using git add . ,and commit and push it to the repository on GitHub. The commit message should be "first task" and your html file name should be task1.html. Also, take a screenshot of your work and upload it with the html file. Feel free to PM/ask on the group if you have any doubts.
